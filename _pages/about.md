Hello! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate of [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), majoring in Big Data Management and Application, at Management Science and Engineering. My research interests includes E-health, User Behavior and Natural Language Processing.

In the future, under the guidance of Professor Guo Xitong, I will conduct my academic research in the Institute of Electronic Health of Harbin University of Technology.

In addition to my work, I am also honored to serve as the Executive Secretary General of MLNLP.
